## Deploy on GitHub Pages (quick steps)
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public is easiest).
2. Upload these files to the repo root (index.html and style.css at top level).
3. Go to: Settings → Pages
4. Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: main → /root → Save
5. Your site will appear at: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/

## Notes
- The contact form opens a pre-filled email (mailto). For a true form submission,
  you can later add Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a small backend.
